# Accelerated-Cpp-Notes
### Chapter 0 - Getting Started
* Angle brackets (<>) is used to call the standard library.
* In `main()` a return of 0 means success, any other value means failure.
* A namespace is a collection of related names.
* Directives begin with '#'.
* Standard library defines all of its names in a namespace called `std`.
* `std::cout` is an operand and `<<` is an operator.
* To the left of the scope operator (`::`) is a namespace called `std`, to the right is a name that is defined in the scope.
* Free form means that spaces are required only when they keep adjacent symbols from running together. 
* The three entities that are not free form.
    * string literals
    * #include name
    * // comment
* The standard library defines its names in headers, which programs access through `#include`.
    * The `<iostream>` header defines the library's input-output facilities.
### Chapter 1 - Working with Strings
* A variable is an object that has a name.
* When reading strings, the library discards whitespace characters from the input.
* Input-output library saves its output in an internal data structure called a buffer.
* The library uses the buffer to accumulate the characters to be written, and flushes the buffer.
* Three events that cause the system to flush the buffer.
   * buffer is full, library will flush automatically
   * library is asked to read input, library immediately flushes the output buffer
   * buffer can be flushed explicitly 
* Operator is overloaded when an operator has different meanings for operands of different types.
* Two string literals cannot be concatenated: that is `“hello” + “World” `is an invalid operation. Although a string and a string literal can be concatenated.
### Chapter 2 - Loops and Counting
* `unsigned` is an integral type that contains only non-negative values.
* `size_t` is an unsigned integral type that can hold any objects size.
* `string::size_type` is an unsigned integral type that can hold the size of any string.
### Chapter 3 - Working with Batches of Data
* If an initial value is not given to a variable, implicity we rely on defualt-initialisation.
* Local variables of built-in type that are not explicity initialised are undefined, which means the variable's value consists of whatever random garbage already happens to occupy memory.
* It is illegal to do anything with an undefined value except to overwrite it with a valid value.
* A `vector` is a container that holds a collection of values.
* `typedef` defines name as a synonym for type.
### Chapter 4 - Organizing Programs and Data
* When referencing a variable, & asks the implementation not to copy the arguement but to bind the paramter directly to the arguement.
### Chapter 5 - Using Sequential Containers and Analyzing Strings
* `vector`s are optimised for fast random access.
   * It is expensive to insert of delete elements other than at the end of a `vector`.
* `list`s are optimised for fast insertion and deletion anywhere within the container. 
   * Do not support indexing.
* We should use iterators if we are only looking for sequential access, we do not need to use indices.   
* If the container is accessed sequentially, that is, if the container grows and shrinks primarily from the end. A `vector` will outperform a `list`.
* If the program deletes many elements from the middle, then `list`s will outperfrom `vector`s.
### General
* Almost always right to use `double` for float-point computations.
* Use `setprecision` manipulator to minimise the part of the program in which precision is set to an unusual value. 
* Use the `size_type` that the library defines to represent container sizes.
