# Accelerated-Cpp-Notes
#### Chapter 0 - Getting Started
* Angle brackets (<>) is used to call the standard library.
* In `main()` a return of 0 means success, any other value means failure.
* A namespace is a collection of related names.
* The standard library defines all of its names in a namespace called `std`.
* `std::cout` is an operand and `<<` is an operator.
* To the left of the scope operator (`::`) is a namespace called `std`, to the right is a name that is defined in the scope.
* Free form means that spaces are required only when they keep adjacent symbols from running together. 
* The three entities that are not free form.
    * string literals
    * #include name
    * // comment
* The standard library defines its names in headers, which programs access through `#include`.
    * The `<iostream>` header defines the library's input-output facilities.
